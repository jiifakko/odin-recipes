            <li>1 tsp pepper flakes or jalapeño pepper</li>
            <li>1 can garbanzo beans, drained</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Step by Step Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Start by browning the lamb on all sides in a large pot with some olive oil</p><p>The goal here is to get a solid crust on the outside of the lamb before adding all of the veggies.</p></li>
            <li><p>Next add the spices and onion and sauté until translucent before tossing in the cubed carrots and root veggies</p>
                <p>Cover with a lid to help the veggies soften up.</p>
                <p>Once the carrots begin to soften, toss in the zucchini, eggplant, and cabbage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sauté for another couple minutes before adding tomato sauce, water cilantro, and parsley.</p>
              <p>Cook over medium heat, slightly covered until all vegetables are cooked through and the lamb reaches an internal temperature of 145.</p>  
              <p>Add in the garbanzo beans and mix thoroughly, continuing to cook just until they are warm and evenly incorporated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While the veggies and meat stew, make your couscous.</p>
                <p>Start with your water in a pot (or follow the ingredients on your packaging).</p>
                <p>Bring the water to a boil before adding the couscous, covering, and removing from the heat. Let sit for 10 minutes then fluff with a fork.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Serve the couscous first, then top carefully with meat and vegetables, finally pouring the broth over the top.</li>
        </ol>
